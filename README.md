# BLND on Tezos

This is a contract code for BLND token on Tezos (a comrade to Ethereum's token with code in [other repository](https://github.com/StakerDAO/blend)).

Contract in this repository is a typical FA1.2 token with additional endpoints for fascilitating bridging with BLND on Ethereum.

Bridging is a feature that allows tokens on Tezos to be freely exchanged to tokens on Ethereum and vice versa. Protocol that we utilize for coin swap is described in detail in [corresponding document](https://github.com/StakerDAO/blend/blob/master/docs/bridgeSpec.md).
